Adamâ€™s Spacely-Caribou-Reference slides should get us setup nearly all the way

Instructions

Install petalinux onto SD card then put inside of FPGA
Set up ssh and static IP for the fpga
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.24
Scp peary onto the FPGA
Combine & build it
Clone spacely 
Try to communicate with the board

Total test stand cost:
ZCU102 (maybe cheaper alternative in future). <= $3600
Car board <= Euros 1200 -> will include level shifter + pulsers on it
Power supply?
Scope?
Linux machine?


- Peary cloned from https://gitlab.cern.ch/abadea/peary. NOTE: in most updated spacely-caribou-reference slides it says to "Pull the aq_dev branch to get the latest I2C bus names for ZCU102" on peary. We did not do this and are working on the badea_052824 branch.
- install vivado. install the drivers for zcu102 using https://docs.amd.com/r/2022.1-English/ug973-vivado-release-notes-install-license/Install-Cable-Drivers
